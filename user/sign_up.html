Raise provides this e-wallet storage and redemption feature for your convenience of use and you agree that when you add any other Gift Card into the Raise mobile wallet (or your web account) not acquired on Raise, that Raise is not responsible or liable for any of those Gift Cards.

We do not guarantee any associated savings or discount a Buyer may receive in conjunction with the Gift Card purchased on Raise. The 1 Year Money-Back Guarantee only applies to Gift Cards purchased on Raise and does not apply to Gift Cards purchased or acquired outside of Raise that you have chosen to add to your Raise mobile wallet or Member Account.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\nFor certain Retailer Gift Cards on Raise, you may be able to transfer Gift Card balances between Gift Cards of the same Retailer. This functionality allows you to transfer Gift Card balances of any Gift Card in your Raise mobile wallet, whether that Gift Card was acquired on Raise or whether you simply added a Gift Card outside of Raise for the purpose of better managing and using your Gift Card. In that circumstance, our \u003ca href=\"https://www.raise.com/guarantee\"\u003e1 Year Money-Back Guarantee\u003c/a\u003e may not apply to that Gift Card, as we may no longer be able to identify where the balance came from in the Gift Card you transferred a balance to. Please read our 1 Year Money-Back Guarantee to fully understand how our guarantee applies or does not apply in that particular circumstance. Irrespective of our Guarantee, Raise is never responsible for the loss of any Gift Card balance transferred from a Gift Card not purchased on Raise, whether in the event of a Gift Card being closed by a Retailer or otherwise.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGift Cards may be subject to various other terms and conditions related to a particular Retailer or Gift Card, including, without limitation, various limitations as to use of the Gift Card, combination with other offers, redemption and voucher use rules, and whether a Gift Card can be used online, in store or both. These terms and conditions are generally presented with the Gift Card on the Site and you agree specifically to have read and accepted these particular terms and conditions when you agree to purchase the Gift Card in question on Raise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRaise is not a party to any transaction that you may enter into with the Retailer as a result of your purchasing a Gift Card on Raise. Raise is not responsible for the quality of goods or services you acquire from a Retailer or otherwise procure using a Gift Card acquired on Raise. If a Retailer were to go out of business or go into bankruptcy prior to your use of all the value on their Gift Card, you understand that your sole and exclusive recourse with respect to the unused value of the Gift Card for that particular Retailer is with the Retailer in question (and not Raise) and, as an unsecured-creditor, you may not be able to recoup the value of any unused Gift Card for such a Retailer. The 1 Year Money-Back Guarantee does not apply in the circumstances that a Retailer ceases to honor its Gift Cards due to its going out of business, into bankruptcy or similar circumstances.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n(b)\n\n    \u003cstrong\u003e\n        \u003cu\u003eSeller’s Representations and Warranties\u003c/u\u003e.\n    \u003c/strong\u003e\nAs a Seller, you represent and warrant that:\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n    \u003cli\u003eAny Gift Card listed for sale on Raise is a valid and authentic Gift Card and is only being listed for sale on Raise;\u003c/li\u003e\n    \u003cli\u003eAny Gift Card listed for sale on Raise is redeemable for the balance stated in connection with the Sale Transaction;\u003c/li\u003e\n    \u003cli\u003eYou have not in any way retained a way to redeem the Gift Card after the Sale Transaction;\u003c/li\u003e\n    \u003cli\u003eThe Gift Card and any interest therein is fully transferable to the Buyer in the manner contemplated by these Terms of Use;\u003c/li\u003e\n    \u003cli\u003eYou are the sole lawful owner of the Gift Card and all interests thereto and that the Gift Card has been obtained in a lawful manner;\u003c/li\u003e\n    \u003cli\u003eIf you convert a physical Gift Card to a digital Gift Card on Raise, you agree to retain the physical Gift Card for 180 days from the Sale Transaction and remit to Raise upon request;\u003c/li\u003e\n    \u003cli\u003eThe Gift Card is not subject to any liens or encumbrances of a third party;\u003c/li\u003e\n    \u003cli\u003eThe Gift Card is in your physical possession or, in the case of electronic Gift Cards, in your sole control;\u003c/li\u003e\n    \u003cli\u003eYou will only list Gift Cards that can be used or sold in the U.S.; and\u003c/li\u003e\n    \u003cli\u003eYou will comply with all other requirements to complete the Sale Transaction, including without limitation, any shipping instructions or procedures required by the Raise.

In each Gift Card Sale Transaction that is completed in accordance with the Terms of Use, you will receive an amount equal the price at which you sell a Gift Card on Raise, less the applicable sales commissions, which is covered in paragraph (g) below. As a Seller on Raise, you may set the price at which you wish to sell your Gift Card(s) on Raise and you may remove any Gift Card from Raise prior to its sale in accordance with these Terms of Use. In addition, you may authorize Raise to automatically adjust your Gift Card sale price and/or commission rate for your Gift Card(s) on Raise; subject to certain parameters you will agree to at the time you place your Gift Card for sale on Raise. Once a Buyer has confirmed a Sale Transaction for a Gift Card, that Gift Card cannot be removed from Raise and Seller is bound to sell that Gift Card at the price set forth in the Sale Transaction. Similarly, once a Buyer has confirmed a purchase of a Gift Card on Raise, that sale is final and cannot be unilaterally canceled by the Buyer. Listing a Gift Card on Raise will not ensure that the Gift Card will sell on Raise. Raise may remove a listing of a Gift Card for sale on Raise for any reason and at any time, including if the Gift Card has not sold over a period of time or if Raise has any concerns related to the sale of any particular Gift Card.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n(e)\n\n    \u003cstrong\u003e\n        \u003cu\u003eGift Card Sale Transaction Verification \u0026 Payment Processing\u003c/u\u003e.\n    \u003c/strong\u003e\nNo Sale Transaction is complete, and Raise will not facilitate the payment of funds to a Seller for a Sale Transaction, until Raise verifies (i) the balance on all Gift Card(s) associated with such Sale Transaction (to the extent possible), (ii) other details related to the Gift Card(s) sold, (iii) the Buyer of the Gift Card(s) in the Sale Transaction and (iv) the Seller of the Gift Card(s). As a part of the verification process, Raise may require a Seller or Buyer to provide additional identification information, including, without limitation, a copy of a valid driver's license (or other form of identification) prior to or after listing Gift Cards for sale. In addition, as a part of the verification process, the Seller authorizes Raise to charge to the Seller’s credit card a $1.00 authorization charge (or such other amount identified to Seller at time of verification on Raise), which amount will be refunded following successful authorization. Members may also be asked to go through additional security procedures and share additional information to confirm their identity. Raise reserves the right to reject any Gift Card(s) that we believe (in our sole discretion) may: (i) be fraudulent, invalid, inauthentic or stolen, (ii) have come from an unauthorized or illegal source, (iii) be related to any illegal activity or (iv) otherwise pose a financial risk to us, our Members, or Retailers. Not all Gift Cards can be sold on Raise. Raise accepts no responsibility for any Gift Card listed on Raise and reserves the right to refuse to process or sell any Gift Card on Raise and may cancel any Sale Transaction in its sole discretion.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\nCertain payment processing services for Raise are provided by Stripe and are subject to the\n    \u003ca target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://stripe.com/us/connect-account/legal\"\u003eStripe Connected Account Agreement\u003c/a\u003e, which includes the\n    \u003ca target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://stripe.com/us/legal\"\u003eStripe Terms of Service \u003c/a\u003e (collectively, the “Stripe Services Agreement”).

As a condition of us enabling payment processing services through Stripe, you agree to provide us accurate and complete information about you, and if applicable, your business. You further authorize us to share all such information, including all transaction information, related to your use of the payment processing services provided by Stripe.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n(f)\n\n    \u003cstrong\u003e\n        \u003cu\u003eRisk of Loss \u0026 Shipping\u003c/u\u003e.\n    \u003c/strong\u003e\nRaise accepts no liability for any lost or damaged packages, or packages altered in transit, whether in transit to the Buyer or in return transit to the Seller. You are responsible for properly shipping any physical Gift Cards sold on Raise to the Buyer of the Gift Card(s), in accordance with our shipping practices found on the Site. When acting as a Seller you agree that until the Buyer receives all Gift Cards associated with a Sale Transaction, you retain title in the Gift Card(s) and remain liable for all risk of loss. Once a Sale Transaction has been confirmed through our confirmation process and the sold Gift Card’s title is transferred to the Buyer, the Buyer is then fully responsible for such Gift Card.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n(g)\n\n    \u003cstrong\u003e\n        \u003cu\u003eCommission and Seller Fees\u003c/u\u003e.\n    \u003c/strong\u003e\nIn connection with all sales of Gift Cards on Raise, Raise charges the Seller of a Gift Card a Sales Commission as well as a listing fee for any physical Gift Cards listed and sold on Raise. The Sales Commission and listing fees (if any) are paid by the Seller from the proceeds of the Gift Card Sale Transaction and are deducted from the sale proceeds prior to crediting the Seller’s Raise account balance. The Sales Commission is fifteen percent (15%) of the Gift Card sale price in the Sale Transaction on Raise, unless (i) you have negotiated a different Sales Commission rate with Raise under a separate arrangement or written agreement with Raise or (ii) Raise has otherwise informed you of a different commission rate or structure at the time of your entering into a Sale Transaction on Raise. For physical Gift Cards on Raise, the listing fee is the greater of $1.00 or 1% of the balance of the relevant physical Gift Card. There is no listing fee associated with electronic Gift Cards sold on Raise. For example, if you sell a physical Gift Card with a balance of $100 and a sale price of $90, the sales commission is $13.50, the listing fee is $1.00, and Raise will pay $75.50 to you via your selected payment method upon consummation of the Sale Transaction.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n(h)\n\n    \u003cstrong\u003e\n        \u003cu\u003ePayment Options \u0026 Fees for Buyers and Sellers\u003c/u\u003e.\n    \u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n    \u003cstrong\u003eBuyers:\u003c/strong\u003e\nWhen you make a purchase on Raise, whether on the website or mobile applications, Raise accepts various forms of payment, including credit cards, debit cards, credit provided by us in your Member Account and Apple Pay, however it is your responsibility to retain the relevant payment card (if any) for purpose of any refund transaction from Raise. By making the purchase on Raise, you warrant that you are authorized to use the designated debit or credit card or other payment method and you authorize us to charge your designated credit or debit card or other payment method for any order you place on Raise. When you provide your payment information, you authorize us (or a third party payment processor) to process and store your payment and related information. In the event that the designated credit or debit card or other payment method cannot be verified, is invalid or is otherwise not acceptable to Raise, we may (i) suspend or cancel your order automatically, (ii) prohibit you from buying and/or selling Gift Cards on Raise until a valid, verifiable credit/debit card is on file with your Member Account and/or (iii) suspend or terminate your account on Raise. Payment card processing fees may apply even if the designated debit or credit card has expired or changed by the time we submit the charges to your card. We are not responsible for any debit card or overdraft fees associated with any order you use a debit card for.
